# Calculator Test
Using TDD, write a parking calculator script that:

- Receives arrival and departure date
- Receives arrival and departure time
- Have the following price table:
    * One hour: 7 dollars
    * Between two and four hours: 11 dollars
    * Between four and six hours: 17 dollars
    * Between six and eight hours: 20 dollars
    * Between eight and ten hours: 24 dollars
    * Between ten and twelve hours: 28 dollars
    * Between twelve and twenty four hours: 34 dollars
- Calculates how much the client will pay based on the data entered
- Displays that information


## Observations
- The client might stay more than one day, there is no limit
- All dates must be available, including weekends

## Start
- Download, clone or fork this repo
- Use the layout given in the /resources folder
- Your code should be inside the /doyourthing folder

## Rules
- You **might** use frameworks, libraries and tools
- You **must** use TDD (Test Driven Development)
- Measurements **might** be in pixels but **can** be in %, em or rem
- The page **should** be responsive for desktop devices only, don't worry about mobile
- You **should** figure out all error cases and create messages for each
